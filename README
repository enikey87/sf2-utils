### Original README

Based on

iffdigest v0.3  A lightweight parser for in-memory EA-IFF-85/RIFF structures

See https://github.com/andrewcb/iffdigest

soundfont-cmdline-tools currently builds two applications:

* sf2-test: Check integrity of soundfonts and output details on data
  structures. Main target was testing soundfont related classes.
* sf2-split: Split all presets in a soundfont into seperate files
